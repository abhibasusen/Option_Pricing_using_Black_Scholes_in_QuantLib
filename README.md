# Option_Pricing_using_Black_Scholes_in_QuantLib
In this program we find out the delta, gamma, vega and the option npv. At the end we plot a graph of the option values.
A sample graph is given for Underlying value=100, risk free rate=6% and delta = 20%.
It is based on the example given in the Quantlib-Python cookbook written by Goutham Balaraman and Luigi Ballabio 
I personally do not know them but had been greatly benefitted by their works
