# Option_Pricing_using_Black_Scholes_in_QuantLib
In this program we find out the delta, gamma, vega and the option npv of a plain vanilla European Option. At the end we plot a graph of the option values.
A sample graph is given for Underlying value=100, risk free rate=6% and volatility = 20% from 4th July,2017 to 4th July,2018.
It is based on the example given in the Quantlib-Python cookbook written by Goutham Balaraman and Luigi Ballabio 
I personally do not know them but had been greatly benefited by their works
